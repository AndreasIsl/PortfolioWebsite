# My first astro project


This was my first project with astro it was the tutorial from de astro docs.
## What I've learned

1. **Astro**: I learned a lot about the framework .

2. **Components**: I learned that components are reusable code.

3. **Dynamic Paths**: With this i learned to generate pages automatically.
